The iOS project in the subfolder **app-Demo-iOS** is tested in the following environment:

* OSX 10.10 or newer
* XCode 8.0 or newer (available on the App Store)
* 64 bit device with iOS 8 or newer

Additional information:

* With a developer account you can debug, run and install the application on any device with the iOS version 8.0 or newer
* You need a device with arm64 support (iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 or newer)
* The XCode environment provides also sophisticated tools for profiling and for the OpenGL ES pipeline analysis.
